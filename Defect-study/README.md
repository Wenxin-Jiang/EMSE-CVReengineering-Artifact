# Open-source bug study:

This folder includes:
  - The bug study instrument we created for data labeling.
  - The tool we developed for random sampling.
  - We sampled 393 open-source issues from 25 GitHub repositories. Here we include:
    - A spreadsheet of 341 CV reengineering defects from 327 issues.
    - A spreadsheet of 91 non-reengineering defects that we filtered out in the data collection.
